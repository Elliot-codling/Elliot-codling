## About me
Hello there. I am Elliot and I love coding. I have always had a passion to code in Python from a young age in High School but I have recently wanted to expand my knowlegde onto more programming languages such as C++, C# and more.

I am passionate about games and the technologies around them that help power creativity. My aim is to learn everything there is to know about Game Engines and Games Programming. 
My previous experience has been creating some games such as: ‚ú®[Asteroids](https://github.com/Elliot-codling/Asteroids)‚ú®

However I want to learn more at a deeper level about Game Engines and as of right now I am currently making one along with my friends.
Here are my top programming languages I have learnt so far:

Thank you for reading about me ‚ù§Ô∏è
